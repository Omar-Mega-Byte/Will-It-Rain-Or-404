# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depend on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Will-It-Rain-Or-404 team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our project. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: [security@weather-app.com] [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED SRY - Contact me at omar.tolis2004@gmail.com] or create a private security advisory on GitHub.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
- **Status Update**: We will provide a more detailed response within 5 business days.
